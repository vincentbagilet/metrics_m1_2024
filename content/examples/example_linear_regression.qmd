title: "Example linear regression"

First, load the `tidyverse` package. 

Then, look at the `cars` data set. What are its dimensions? What do the variables represent? Use the `help` function.

How are `dist` and `speed` related?

```{r eval=FALSE}
car |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = , y = )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Run a regression using the `lm` function. 

Interpret the results.
