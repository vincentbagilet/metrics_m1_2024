## Objective

Using OLS does not mean that everything has to be linear in the model; it means that the model has to be linear in its parameters. In this session, we will discuss why and how we can introduce non-linearities in our model.

## Session Outline

1.  Quizz
2.  Recap' from last week (+ derivation formula of the variance of the OLS estimator)
3.  Introduction to model specification
4.  Logarithms
5.  Quadratics
6.  Indicators
7.  Interactions

## Exercise

Now that you have a basic knowledge of `R`, we will implement a simple analysis in `R`. You can find the exercise [here](content/exercises/ex_01_linear_regression.qmd).
