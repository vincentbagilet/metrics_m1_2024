## Objective

A linear regression does not mean that everything has to be linear in the model; it means that the model has to be linear in its parameters. In this session, we will discuss why and how we can introduce non-linearities in our model and model heterogeneity.

## Session Outline

1.  Quizz
2.  Recap' from last week (+ derivation formula of the variance of the OLS estimator)
3.  Exercise: Hands-on linear regression
4.  Introduction to model specification
5.  Logarithms
6.  Quadratics
7.  Indicators
8.  Interactions

## Exercise

Why use particular functional transformations for the variables in your model?

Let's try to answer part of this question using an example. You can find the associated exercise [here](content/ex/ex_2_specification.qmd).
