## Objective

The OLS estimator, under some conditions, has some neat properties. In this session, we will described these properties and some of the necessary conditions for these properties to hold.
:::

## Session Outline

1.  Quizz
2.  Discussion on research questions
3.  Estimates and uncertainty
4.  Some properties estimators can have
5.  Optimality conditions: conditions under which the OLS estimator has some of these properties
6.  Mathematical derivation (bias and variance of the OLS estimator)

## Materials

`r fontawesome::fa("file-powerpoint")` [Open slides](../../slides/lecture_2/slides_2_properties.html)

```{r out.width='100%'}
#| echo: false

knitr::include_url("../../slides/lecture_2/slides_2_properties.html")
```

<!-- These slides are built on the material ClÃ©ment Gorin taught two years ago. -->

<!-- *This section will describe the exercise that we will do in class and provide links to the data sets and tools used.* -->

<!-- Since the TDs have not yet started, we will use Google Collabs to run today's code online. In the future, you will use R Studio. -->
