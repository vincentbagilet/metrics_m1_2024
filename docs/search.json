It shall provide fundamental tools to quantitatively explore relevant social science questions.\nIntuition will be central to this class. A typical lecture will first discuss the main intuition related to the topics of the day through a set of concrete examples and realistic simulations. Most sessions will also involve hands-on R exercises and data analyses to allow grasping the main challenges associated with the topic of interest. After this description of the goals, the motivation, and the intuition behind the aspects explored in the lecture, it will turn to a comprehensive theorizing and mathematical formalization.\nThe first part of this class will discuss how to implement a simple but sensible regression-based analysis. It will introduce a canonical regression method, its properties and discuss the implications of its associated assumptions on the outcomes of the analysis.\nThe second part (last four lectures), will discuss in depth the theoretical underpinning behind the large sample properties of estimators and how to design a proper hypothesis test."

Questions will mostly require you to summarize the previous lecture (topic, goal, main message), define a few key terms and give simple intuitions.\n\n\nFinal Exam (40%)\nThe final exam will have two part. First, a computer-based test will be held at the end of the semester. You will be given a dataset with a set of questions to perform applied analysis including estimation, hypothesis testing, the detection and correction of estimation issues, and inference. Second, a written-based test where you will solve some mathematical exercises on the topics covered in class (bias, variance, convergence of a estimator, …)\n\n\nFinal Project (40%)\nIn this project, by groups of two, you will have to investigate a research question of your choice using some of the techniques studied in class.\nYou will write a short standalone report (5 pages maximum) and present your code and analysis in a Quarto document.\n\n\n\nCriteria\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nResearch question of interest to economists\n\n\nBackground\nShort review of the related literature\n\n\nData\nData collection and construction of the datasets\n\n\nModel\nChoice of the appropriate model and specification\n\n\nEstimation\nAppropriate diagnostics and corrections\n\n\nResults\nInterpretation and answer to the research question\n\n\nWriting\nClear and concise.
