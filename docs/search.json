After some probability reviews, we discuss some properties estimator can have and then the condition under which these properties holds. Once this has been discuss, we derive the mathematical expression for the bias and variance of the OLS estimator, underlying where the assumptions come to play.\n\nSession Outline\n\nQuizz\nDiscussion on research questions\nEstimates and uncertainty\nSome properties estimators can have\nOptimality conditions: conditions under which the OLS estimator has some of these properties\nMathematical derivation (bias and variance of the OLS estimator)"

Let’s create a tibble version of this data set, using the function as_tibble(); run the following line of code:\n\nwage &lt;- as_tibble(wage1)\n\nWhat does each variable represent? (use the help() function). How many observations are there in this data set? .\n\n\n“Research” Question\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\n\n\n\nWe will study how to better explain/predict hourly wage, based on the set of covariates available in the data set\n\n\nWe want to build a model that accurately describes the variation in wage. Why can understanding how wage evolves with various covariates matter for economics research?\n\n\nSummarising the Data\nBefore anything, let’s quickly explore the data. To have an overview of the dataset, we can use the function glimpse(wage).\nWhat type of variable does profocc seem to be? ContinuousBinary Confirm this by exploring the documentation for the data set (the help)\nThe summary() function can also provide interesting information on the dataset. Call this function. What is the median number of years of educations in the data set? \nWhat is the proportion of married individuals in this data set? 1\n\n\nDistribution of Wage\nWe want to study the variation in wage, before anything, let’s plot its distribution as we did in the previous exercise!\n\n# plot distrib wage\n\nDo you notice anything weird or erroneous? \n\n\nRelationship between wage and education\nWe can then explore its correlation with education. Which ggplot function should we use? \n\n# plot relationship between wage and education\n\nWhat do we notice?\nIn addition, larger levels of education seem to be associated with largersmaller hourly wages.\nWe may also be interested in disparities by gender. We can plot the same graph distinguishing by gender. To do so, add color = female within the aes() function: aes(x = ..., y = ..., color = female).\nggplot treats female as a continuous variable (an integer). Instead, this variable is binary. To transform it as categorical variable, we can use the as_factor() function: aes(x = ..., y = ..., color = as_factor(female)).\nFor a given level of education, the wage of female individuals seems to be largerloweridentical than the wage of non-female ones.\nDoes the relationship between wage and education seem different for female and non-female?\n\n\nRelationship Between Wage and Other Variables\nGo on with this data exploration: look at the correlation between wage and experience, tenure and their squares. Can you see a clear relationship between the square of experience and wage? YesNo\nDoes that mean that there is no statistical relationship between these two variables? YesNo\nHow would you expect this relationship to be positivenullnegative Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can do a lot more data exploration using graphs but also tables.

    "text": "Model and estimation\n\nModel\nAssume you want to write a model to estimate the relationship between gdpPercap and lifeExp (or transformed versions of these variables) with OLS. For the resulting model to accurately represent the data generating process, the relationship between the variables therefore has to be linear. You want to write a model of the form\n\\[y = \\alpha + \\beta x + e\\] What should be \\(y\\) in your case? . And x? .\n\n\nRegression\nTo estimate this model, we will use the lm function. Which formula should you pass to the function? . Run the estimtion and display the output using the summary() function.\n\nreg &lt;- lm(data = ..., formula = ...)\n\n\nsummary(...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBefore doing the next questions, please read the slides, including the few that we did not have time to cover in class, they will help you answer the questions.\n\n\nWhat is the point estimate for lifeExp? . How would you interpret this coefficient?\n\n Comparing two countries, we expect a country in which the GDP per capita is $1 larger than in the other to have a life expectancy that is on average 8.4 years larger Comparing two countries, we expect a country in which the GDP per capita is 1% larger than in the other to have a life expectancy that is on average 8.4 years larger Comparing two countries, we expect a country in which the GDP per capita is $1 larger than in the other to have a life expectancy that is on average 8.4% larger Comparing two countries, we expect a country in which the GDP per capita is 1% larger than in the other to have a life expectancy that is on average 0.084 years larger Comparing two countries, we expect a country in which the GDP per capita is 1% larger than in the other to have a life expectancy that is on average 8.4% larger Comparing two countries, we expect a country in which the GDP per capita is 1% larger than in the other to have a life expectancy that is on average 0.084% larger\n\nIs this number exact or is it an approximation? ExactApproximation\nDoes this number seem reasonable to you? Think about what it entails.\n\n\nHeteroskedasticity\nLet’s now look at the residuals of this regression in order to explore potential risks of heteroskedasticity. We can retrieve the residuals of a regression with the function resid &lt;- residuals(reg) or by extracting them from the output of the regression: resid &lt;- reg$residuals. Try these two approaches and look at the resulting vecotrs.\n\nresid &lt;- residuals(reg)\nresid &lt;- reg$residuals\n\nRemember what heteroskedasticity is. Which scatter plot should we plot to observe it, if there is any to observe?  against .\nTo do that, we should store these variable into a dataframe, using the tibble function. Let’s call them x1 and x2 for the sake of the example. Replace x1 and x2 by the relevant variables in the following code. Note that to access variables in the gapminder dataset, you need to use $: for instance to access the variable year, write gapminder$year.\n\ndata_residuals &lt;- tibble(name_x1 = x1, name_x2 = x2)\n  \nggplot(data = data_residuals, aes(x = .., y = ..)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth()\n\nDoes there seem to be some heteroskedasticity here? YesNo\nWhy is it problematic?\nThere are actually formal tests for heteroskedasticity. They however go beyond what is covered in this section of the class.\n\n\nDistribution of the residuals\nWe saw in class that when the residuals are normally distributed, our estimator has nice properties. Plot an histogram to describe the distribution of the residuals. Which function should you use? \n\nggplot(data = data_residuals, aes(x = .., y = ..)) + \n  ...\n\nDoes that seem roughly normally distributed? YesNo\nTo actually test for normality, there is a bunch of tests one can implement but you will learn more about these later. For example, we can plot the residuals against draws from a normal distribution. If the residuals are normally distributed, the resulting points will be on the identity line. To plot this, we can use the geom_qq() function (geom_qq_line() plots the identity line):\n\ndata_residuals |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(sample = resid)) + \n  geom_qq() + \n  geom_qq_line()"

A typical lecture will first discuss the main intuition related to the topics of the day through a set of concrete examples and realistic simulations. Most sessions will also involve hands-on R exercises and data analyses to allow grasping the main challenges associated with the topic of interest. After this description of the goals, the motivation, and the intuition behind the aspects explored in the lecture, it will turn to a comprehensive theorizing and mathematical formalization.\nThe first part of this class will discuss how to implement a simple but sensible regression-based analysis. It will introduce a canonical regression method, its properties and discuss the implications of its associated assumptions on the outcomes of the analysis.\nThe second part (last four lectures), will discuss in depth the theoretical underpinning behind the large sample properties of estimators and how to design a proper hypothesis test."
