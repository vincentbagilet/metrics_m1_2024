Here are a few resources that can help you build nice and relevant data viz in R.\n\n-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) provides a nice introduction to [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), THE package to build plots in R. To go further you can read [this book](https://ggplot2-book.org/).\n-   [Modern Data Visualization with R](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/index.html) and [Data Visualization - A practical introduction](https://socviz.co/index.html) both discuss key data viz concepts and teaches you how to apply them in R and ggplot.\n-   [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) does not provide R code directly but provides a great introduction to data viz and the code can be found on [the book's GitHub](https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz).\n\n## Finding data\n\nData are obviously central to statistical analyses. Identifying relevant datasets is often not an easy task. Here is a non-exhaustive list of places where to look for useful datasets.\n\n-   [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/): a search engine for datasets hosted in thousands of repositories across the Web. Info [here](https://blog.google/products/search/making-it-easier-discover-datasets/)\n-   [Data Europa](https://data.europa.eu/en): European public sector datasets\n-   [Data.gouv](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/): open platform for French public data\n-   [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/): a weekly newsletter providing useful and often original datasets. There is a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) archiving all the data sets\n-   [A currated list of French open data sources](https://axysweb.com/top-15-des-sources-open-data/)\n-   [Quantitative Social Science Data](https://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/data/#economics): a curated list of economics datasets\n-   [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#education): a list of topic-centric public data sources\n-   [PolData](https://github.com/erikgahner/PolDatahttps://github.com/erikgahner/PolData): a list of political science datasets\n-   [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/ICPSR/index.html) stores, curates, and provides access to scientific data so others can reuse the data\n-   [Harvard dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/): A repository of datasets used in published research articles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
