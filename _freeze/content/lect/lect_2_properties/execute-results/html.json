In this session, we describe these properties and some of the necessary conditions for these properties to hold. This session is very much centered around maths, may be a bit arid but is a cornerstone for everything we will learn afterwards.\n\nWe start by discussing and illustrating the fact that estimators are random variables (estimates are realizations of these random variables) and therefore come with uncertainty. After some probability reviews, we discuss some properties estimator can have and then the condition under which these properties holds. Once this has been discuss, we derive the mathematical expression for the bias and variance of the OLS estimator, underlying where the assumptions come to play.\n\n### Session Outline\n\n1.  Quizz\n2.  Discussion on research questions\n3.  Estimates and uncertainty\n4.  Some properties estimators can have\n5.  Optimality conditions: conditions under which the OLS estimator has some of these properties\n6.  Mathematical derivation (bias and variance of the OLS estimator)\n\n## Materials\n\n`<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 384 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:0.75em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:currentColor;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M64 464c-8.8 0-16-7.2-16-16V64c0-8.8 7.2-16 16-16H224v80c0 17.7 14.3 32 32 32h80V448c0 8.8-7.2 16-16 16H64zM64 0C28.7 0 0 28.7 0 64V448c0 35.3 28.7 64 64 64H320c35.3 0 64-28.7 64-64V154.5c0-17-6.7-33.3-18.7-45.3L274.7 18.7C262.7 6.7 246.5 0 229.5 0H64zm72 208c-13.3 0-24 10.7-24 24V336v56c0 13.3 10.7 24 24 24s24-10.7 24-24V360h44c42 0 76-34 76-76s-34-76-76-76H136zm68 104H160V256h44c15.5 0 28 12.5 28 28s-12.5 28-28 28z\"/></svg>`{=html} [Open slides](../../slides/lecture_2/slides_2_properties.html)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"../../slides/lecture_2/slides_2_properties.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n<!-- These slides are built on the material ClÃ©ment Gorin taught two years ago. -->\n\n<!-- *This section will describe the exercise that we will do in class and provide links to the data sets and tools used.* -->\n\n<!-- Since the TDs have not yet started, we will use Google Collabs to run today's code online.
