You will have to run most of your code on `RStudio`, on your own computer.\n::: \n\nFirst, let's load useful packages. For now, we will only need the `tidyverse` package. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The `cars` dataset\n\nFirst, we will work with the `cars` data set.\n\n### Exploring the data set\n\nThis data set is automatically loaded to your `R environment`; you can call it directly. What are its dimensions?\n\n<input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='2' data-answer='[\"50\"]'/> rows and <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='1' data-answer='[\"2\"]'/> columns.\n\nWhat does each variable represent? Use the `help` function to answer this question.\n\n::: callout-tip\nThere is a shortcut for the `help` function: just put a `?` before the function or data set you want help for, *eg*, `help(print)` and `?print` will have the same effect. Try it out!\n:::\n\n### Ploting the relationship\n\nHow are `dist` and `speed` related? First, we will plot the raw data using a scatter plot and `ggplot`. \n\n::: {.callout-important}\n`ggplot` is a tool that allows you to make awesome plots in R. It is based on the Grammar of Graphics, a theoretical approach to make graph, that essentially builds graphs layer by layer. \n::: \n\nWhich variable should you put on the $y$ axis? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='4' data-answer='[\"dist\"]'/> . Why? \n\nNow, fill in the blanks in the following chunk of code to plot a graph describing the relationship between the two variables. To do so, replace `x_variable` and `y_variable` with the name of the variables you want to plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = cars, aes(x = x_variable, y = y_variable)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nDo not forget to label the axes (indicating the units) and give a title to your graph. You can also play around with the various lines, for instance adding them one after the other, to understand their use. You will learn more about `ggplot` in TD.\n\n### A first regression\n\nNow that we have quickly plotted the data, let's run our first regression. To do so, we will use the `lm()` function. What does `lm` stands for? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase regex' size='15' data-answer='[\"linear models?$\"]'/>. \n\nTo regress, `y` on `x`, we need to write the formula `y ~ x`. Write your formula of interest for the `cars` dataset and run the function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(formula = y_variable ~ x_variable, data = cars)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can store the result fo this regression, in the `reg` variable for instance. Use the \"assignment\" sign `<-` and this will create the `reg` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreg <- lm(formula = y_variable ~ x_variable, data = cars)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe nice thing is that you then can call the `summary()` function on this object:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(reg)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere is a lot of information there. What is the value of the coefficient of interest? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.1' size='3' data-answer='[\"3.9\"]'/>. \n\nInterpret this coefficient. What word should your sentence start with? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='9' data-answer='[\"comparing\"]'/>.\n\nAs always, there is some uncertainty associated with the value of this coefficient. What is the standard error of this coefficient? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='4' data-answer='[\"0.41\",\".41\"]'/>. The estimate is statistically significant? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
